# ENPM673-Project-2
# Car Lane Detection
This repository has a report in pdf format with  descriptions of problem 1 and 2. All the solutions of the problem set have been implemented in ```night_vision.py``` and ```lane_segmentation.py```. There is also a .ipynb notebook for testing.
## Getting Started
Download the entire .zip and extract in a folder. A python environment is required to run the codes.
## Prerequisites
The programs uses numpy, matplotlib and opencv libraries. Hence, these libraries should be pre-installed. 
## Running the programs
1. Open Terminal (for Linux and MacOS) or command line (for windows)
2.  Navigate to the $(extracted folder)/code directory using ```cd $(path_to_folder)/code```
3.  Run the following command for the python programs 
	- ```python night_vision.py``` for getting the visualising the solutions to problem 2
    - ```python lane_segmentation.py``` for getting the visualising the solutions to problem 2
